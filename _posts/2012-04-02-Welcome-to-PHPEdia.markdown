## A new _collab_ way for good knowledge
Hello guys...

Some time ago, me and Thiago, were drinking and talking about PHP and OpenSource...

We were talking about articles, tutorials, and other stuff, and how the community uses/helps this.

First we remembered the blogs, forums and location-based community websites, like [PHPSP](http://phpsp.org.br), a Brazilian(São Paulo) PHP User Group. Then some _zine_ like [PHP Architect](http://www.phparch.com/) and finishing with good sites like [Net tuts +](http://net.tutsplus.com/).

So in this way, and _drunked_ _away_, we wondered: _Man_, _how_ _the_ _whole_ _community_ _can_ _help_ _others_ _with_ _PHP_ _knowledge_ _?_

## Man, how the whole community can help others with the PHP knowledge
First, we thought about _Collab_ _Articles_

A kind of platform where people can share articles, tutorials and alike with others.

So, we realized something like a HUB...

If we wanted to share things, and make some sort of PHP Hub... why we don't use GITHUB for this?

## The GitHub
So, and if people can create their articles and share it with me over github? an article pull request!

Cool, it would make easy our "Share schema" and Github is all about... sharing code(knowledge)

So, we can make a policy, people can use github to contribute with this Open project! great!

## First problem

So, people will download the pdf files?? without a web interface? just... download and that's it?

## First (and unique) solution

Wow, we can use github pages for this! people can send a "pull request", and when it's approved we generate a new page into this repo!

Cool, how we do this? with Github pages and Jekyll! simple... so, we have the PHP "Enciclopedia" hub ;) Cool

## How it works at all?
So, you need to see our rules, and basicly you will write your articles in Markdow(or textile) and that's it :)

{% highlight php %}
TextMate is a good editor to write markdown... but you can find others, even online editors
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you can share with others and this way we are disseminating PHP Knowledge :)

## Contribute n enjoy :)

Simple, take a look at our [github](https://github.com/phpedia/phpedia.github.com) and feel free to contribute, improve and others :)
